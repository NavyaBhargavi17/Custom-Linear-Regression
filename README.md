# Custom Linear Regression (Least Squares Method)

This project implements **Linear Regression from scratch** using the **Least Squares Method**, without using any external ML libraries.

## 🚀 Features
- Calculates slope (m) and intercept (c) manually.
- Predicts values using the learned model.
- Visualizes data points and the regression line.

---

## 🛠 Steps to Run in Google Colab
1. Copy the code from `custom_linear_regression.py`.
2. Paste it into a Google Colab notebook.
3. Run all cells to see:
   - Slope & Intercept values.
   - Predicted outputs.
   - Regression line graph.

---

## 📊 Example Output
- **Slope (m):** 0.70  
- **Intercept (c):** 2.60  

### Graph Example:

## 📂 Files
- `custom_linear_regression.py` → Python script with the complete code.
